# Lesson 2: Working with Gatsby pages

1. Gatsby comes with folder structure which has src/pages directories. This pages folder contains the files which will decide what our content will look like in web pages.The default is index.js page which represents the home page and we can create other pages powered by react and jsx to represent different routes in our website.

2. I created an about page, contacts page and a blog page. Next we will see how to point to these pages through links.
